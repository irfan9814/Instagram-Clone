## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>
Instagram Clone is a full-stack software application developed to replicate the core features of the popular social media platform, Instagram. This project includes the basic features such as user registration, profile creation, uploading and sharing photos and videos, commenting and liking functionality, a news feed to display user activity, and direct messaging.
The aim of this project is to provide a similar user experience to the original app, with additional features and customization options. With this clone, users can create their own profiles, connect with friends and family, share their photos and videos, and engage with others in a social network environment.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

### Prerequisites
What things you need to install the software and how to install them.

- Visual Studio Code
- Spring Tool Suite
- MySQL Workbench


### Installing
A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

Say what the step will be

- Download MySQL Workbench from https://www.mysql.com/downloads/


## üîß Running the tests <a name = "tests"></a>
Explain how to run the automated tests for this system.

### Break down into end to end tests
- To run the website, we need to open the terminal in vs code and run the command npm start. It will start the server on localhost.
- We also need to run the Java Application through Spring Tool Suite.
- Database through MySQL Workbench.
